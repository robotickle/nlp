CS 224n

1. Deep Learning is a part of machine learning.
	1. traditional macinelearning - DecisionTrees, Naive bayes, logistic regression, svm, ... statistics - 
	=====================================================================================================
				user will work hard to make the machine work - user will learn not machine.
					user creates features, like hiphens, dash.
					every month bunch or eningeers in google creates features that is used for search.
					what was the machine doing - All it was doing was neumerical optimization.
																	  ------------------------		
						building linear classifier, putting parameter weight infront of a feature.
						machine learning job was to optimize that paramter.

	2. DL (is part of Representation Learning)- user prepares data, DL makes machine learn.
	==========================================
				Create multiple layers of learnt representations, be able to outperform other learnt system.


				All inventions were done in 80s and 90s, but now its successful due to convergence of
				1. - Vast amount of Data.
				2. - Compute Power.
				parallel compute of these vectors using GPUs. - hence successful, and more algorithms.


				- Dahl et. al (2010) - went to microsoft. another studend of hinton went to google.
				- need cs229, cs221

				pre-requisite:
					- multivariate calculus, linear algebra, basic prob. algebra.
